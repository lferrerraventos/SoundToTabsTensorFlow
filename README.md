## Link to TensorFlow notebooks

* [SoundToTabs POC](notebooks/TFG_75_679_TensorFlow_POC_GuitarSoundToTabs.ipynb)
* [SoundToTabs Notes CNN](notebooks/TFG-75.679-TensorFlow-SoundToTabs-NotesCNN.ipynb) This notebook creates a categorical cross entropy CNN model to detect guitar single notes
* [SoundToTabs Chords CNN](notebooks/TFG-75.679-TensorFlow-SoundToTabs-ChordsCNN.ipynb) This notebook creates a categorical cross entropy CNN model to detect guitar chords.
* [SoundToTabs Note vs Chord CNN](notebooks/TFG-75.679-TensorFlow-SoundToTabs-NoteVsChordCNN.ipynb) This notebook creates a binary CNN model to differentiate between a guitar chord and a note.
* [SoundToTabs Audio Note Segregation](notebooks/TFG-75.679-TensorFlow-SoundToTabs-AudioNotesSegregation.ipynb) This aims to segregate into multiple segments a guitar recording.
